# Searchable Dropdown Component

This project is a **Searchable Dropdown** built with **React.js**. It allows users to search through a list of items fetched from an API and select one. The dropdown suggests items based on the search query, and the user can select from the available options.

## Features

- Fetches data from an external API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`).
- Provides a live search as the user types.
- Displays suggestions based on the search query.
- Shows the selected item after choosing an option.
- Handles loading and error states while fetching data.

## Hooks Used

- **`useState`**: Used to manage the state of data, search query, selected item, loading status, and error handling.
- **`useEffect`**: Used to fetch data from the API when the component first renders.
